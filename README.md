#### 😉 What do I like about web development?
What I like the most is the possibility of constantly learn and never stop growing.
I'm constantly learning new tools to improve my skills and be more productive.
The possibility of working as a team, and being able to learn from my colleagues and at the same time empower them to find new and better solutions together.
